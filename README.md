# OctoPrint and OctoLapse Profiles for Prusa XL Multi Tool 3D Printers
Requires Prusa Firmware 5.1.0 or Higher

In this repo you will find a couple of files you can import into OctoPrint to enable both OctoPrint control and OctoLapse timelapse for use with a Prusa XL 5 Head Multi-Tool 3D Printer.

I originally created these profiles by modifying the OctoPrint and OctoLapse Prusa MINI profiles to have a larger bed area, multiple tool heads, and slightly different x y offsets than the Prusa Mini profiles had.
